##Hotel Chain A, a major presence in the hospitality sector, manages three different categories
of hotels They are City Hotels, Airport Hotels, and Resorts. During the last 15 months the hotel
chain has been dealing with a high volume of booking cancellations and no-shows, causing
disruptions in operations and resulting in significant revenue losses. To address this issue, Hotel
Chain A is looking to utilize data analytics to forecast cancellation probabilities and create
tactics to reduce these occurrences. The primary goal is to analyse historical booking data to
uncover patterns and factors that lead to cancellations and no-shows. This analysis will help to
create predictive models to anticipate potential cancellations for future bookings.
